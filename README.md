# HID test over WebHID for EV3

This is a test code to experiment with EV3 flashing over WebHID.

Disclaimer: ugly and draft code for first prototype only.

Putting the EV3 in update manually is very simple. This manual approach is preferred, so it doesn't matter what is currently on the brick:

- Make sure the EV3 is off.
- hold right button while you turn the EV3 on normally.
- you will see "updating..." on the screen.That's it.
